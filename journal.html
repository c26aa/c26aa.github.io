When I started making my webiste I learned about the geniuses behind the computers we see today. All the interface is just a graphic remake of the code I am working with now. Its incredible to think about how computer used to be like without this UI. As I am continuing to work on my website I have gotten much more familar and confident with coding. I have learned the different types of languages and how they work. I have also learned how to make links between different pages and how to make text appear.</p></left>

I am starting to get more familiar with divs and how to add text to them and how to align them. I have added many moet o my website than before and have made it look much better now.

 <p>Journal Entry 3: <br>
 For homework I made a color changing bar at the top of my projects page. It changes to four different colors. The way I think it works is by specifying the animation name that you chose you can allow the code to be run in a certain way. Additionally, by using the keyframes tag you can select when and how the div changes.

 	Journal Entry 4: <br>
 	I learned how to use Javascript to make an animation where multiple copies of an image appear. When we get more advanced we will be able to make different colors appear as well as different images. When I get more used to Javascript I will be able to incorperate it into my website to make it more interactive.
