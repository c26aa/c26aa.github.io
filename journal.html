When I started making my webiste I learned about the geniuses behind the computers we see today. All the interface is just a graphic remake of the code I am working with now. Its incredible to think about how computer used to be like without this UI.</p></left>

<p>Journal Entry 2: <br>
As I am continuing to work on my website I have gotten much more familar and confident with coding. I have learned the different types of languages and how they work. I learned how to make links between different pages and how to make text appear. </p>
